        answer: Based on the context given, Serif et al. (2026) claim that the overwhelming
        cause of regime collapse arises from economic factors. Yet, most other scholars
        (Gerald and Robinson for example) believe the collapse was due to social unrest
        because of the prolonged epidemic of 2025. I tend to agree with the majority
        - although I can see both sides. Thus my response is that the social unrest
        was the significant factor in the collapse of the regime.", "role": "user"}],
